![Redirector](https://github.com/WillemLabu/wordpress-redirector/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

A WordPress theme that always redirects to /wp-admin/

----

This theme is intended for use with the [WP API Plugin](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API).

No content is rendered in WP itself, and should be done with some other engine consuming the `<site>/wp-json/<endpoints>` set out in WP API.

This allows you to build a custom front-end on top of the power of WP's CMS.
